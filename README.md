# Forms And Basic Associations Rails

## Objectives

1. Populate select options based on association options.
2. Assign a FK based on an input box value directly through mass assignment. (post[category_id])
3. Define a belongs_to association writer.
4. Build a form field that will delegate to a belongs_to association writer. (post#category_name=) through controller mass assignment.
5. Define a has_many association writer.
6. Build a form field that will delegate to a has_many association writer. (owner#pet_names=) through controller mass assignment.

## The problem

Let's say we have a simple blogging system. Our models are Post and Category. A Post belongs_to a Category.

```
# app/models/post.rb
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :category
end

# app/models/category.rb
class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :posts
end
```

When a user creates a post, how will they specify what category it belongs to?

## Using the category ID

As a first pass, we might build a form like this:

```
<%= form_for @post do |f| %>
  <label>Category: <input type="text" name="post[category_id]"></label>
  <textarea name="post[content]"></textarea>
<% end %>
```

This will work if we wire up our `PostsController` with the right parameters:

```
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    Post.create(post_params)
  end

  private

  def post_params
    params.require(:post).permit(:category_id, :content)
  end
end
```

But as a user experience, this is miserable. I have to know the id of the category I
want to use. As a user, it is very unlikely that I know this or want to.

We could rewrite our controller to accept a `category_name` instead of an id:

```
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    category = Category.find_or_create_by(name: params[:category_name])
    Post.create({content: params[:content], category: category})
  end
end
```

But we'll have to do this anywhere we want to set the category for a Post. When we're
setting a Post's categories, the one thing we know we have is a Post object. What if we could
move this logic to the model?

Specifically, what if we gave the Post model a `category_name` attribute?

## You can define your own attributes on models

Since our ActiveRecord models are still just Ruby classes, we can define our own set
methods:

```
# app/models/post.rb
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
   def category_name=(name)
     self.category = Category.find_or_create_by(name: name)
   end
end
```

Now we can set `category_name` on a post. We can do it when creating a post too, so our
controller becomes quite simple again:

```
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    Post.create(post_params)
  end

  private

  def post_params
    params.require(:post).permit(:category_name, :content)
  end
end
```

Notice the differenceâ€”we're now accepting a category name, rather than a category id.
We can change the view as well now:

```
<%= form_for @post do |f| %>
  <label>Category: <input type="text" name="post[category_name]"></label>
  <textarea name="post[content]"></textarea>
<% end %>
```

Now the user can enter a category by name, a much friendlier experience.

## Selecting from existing categories

If we want to let the user pick from existing categories, we can use a the [collection_select]
helper to render a `<select>` tag:

```
<%= form_for @post do |f| %>
  <%= f.collection_select :category, Category.all, :id, :name %>
  <textarea name="post[content]"></textarea>
<% end %>
```

This will create a drop down selection input where the user can pick a category.

However, we've lost the ability for users to create their own categories.

That might be what you want. For example, the content management system for a magazine
would probably want to enforce that the category of an article is one of the sections
actually printed in the magazine.

In this case, I think we want to give users the flexibility to either create a new category,
or pick an existing one. What we want is autocompletion, which we can get with a [datalist]:

```
<%= form_for @post do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :category, list: "categories_autocomplete" %>
  <datalist id="categories_autocomplete">
    <%= Category.all.each do |category| %>
      <option value="<%= category.name %>">
    <% end %>
  </datalist>
  <textarea name="post[content]"></textarea>
<% end %>
```

## Updating multiple rows

Let's extend our domain model so Posts have Tags.

Unlike with Categories, a Post may have many Tags.

```
# app/models/tag.rb
class Tag < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :post
end

# app/models/post.rb
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :category
  has_many :tags
  # ...
end
```

How do we let the user specify multiple values in a form?

### Using array parameters

Rails uses a [naming convention] to let you submit an array of values to a controller.

If you put this in a view,

```
<%= form_for @post do |f| %>
  <input name="tag_names[]">
  <input name="tag_names[]">
  <input name="tag_names[]">
<% end %>
```

When the form is submitted, your controller will have access to a `tag_names` param, which
will be an array of strings.

We can write a setter method for this, just like we did for `category_name`:

```
# app/models/post.rb
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
   def tag_names=(names)
     names.each do |name|
       self.tags.build(name: name)
     end
   end
end
```

We're using the `build` method here to create and add tags. This ActiveRecord method creates
a new instance of the other side of a relation, setting the foreign keys correctly.

Now we can use the same wiring in the controller to set `tag_names` from `params`:

```
# app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    Post.create(post_params)
  end

  private

  def post_params
    params.require(:post).permit(:category_name, :content, :tag_names)
  end
end
```
